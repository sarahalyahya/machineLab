# Cam, Slider, Crank + Motor


For this task, we were asked to build a cam and cam follower system, as well as a crank and slider system and then run it for a minute using a motor. To be honest, this was really challenging for me, it took me way longer than I'd like to admit to finish my unpolished and imperfect machine -- but I'm proud I got it done! I actually didn't think I would be able to, but managed with a lot of time and trial and error. 

### Technical Difficulties 
Many of the issues I faced were actually some that we discussed during class so it was helpful to think back to how we solved them and try to apply that myself. For example the skewer I was using for the cam was wobbling horizontally too much, so the waterbottle caps were a great fix for that

Perhaps the most difficult part of this task for me was the attachment between the wheel and the central skewer. I've cut tens of triangles and glued them only to realize that they weren't the best fit after trying to run the machine for over a minute. Finally, what worked well for me was to add an additional, smaller, non-circular layer between the circle glued to the wheel and the skewer that I can glue triangles to. This made my connection more solid and able to last for over a minute.

### Improvements
If I were to improve on my machine and make it better, I would probably create a more elegant "table" for my slider and try to figure out how to decrease the effect of friction in that interaction. I would also just do things in a more precise and polished manner so my machine can be more aesthetically pleasing.
