# Machine Sketch 2 
## Idea and Theme
When we were discussing themes in the classroom, everytime the discussion went back to the theme of the UAE, I couldn't stop thinking about Arab and Emirati coffee culture, and how that plays a role in the perception of time in the region. For this reason,the mechanism I'm sketching out includes a gahwa (coffee) cup traveling in a traditional coffee tent, and then shaking once it reaches the end of its horizontal path at the end of the hour. This is inspired by the tradition in Arabic coffee drinking, where guests have to shake their cups to indicate that they are done drinking coffee, and do not want their cup to be refilled. 

## Motions
So, the machine has two main motions. Horizontal travel on a belt of some sorts, and then shaking around an access.

So, over the hour, the cup travels to the end of the horizontal path, and then at the end of the hour it shakes, indicating that an hour has passed. Afterward, it snaps back to the start of the path and starts its movement all over again. 

## Motors needed
I would need a servo motor for the first movement and a stepper motor for the second, given that the second movement is more limited and percise -- it's just a slight shake from side to side. I'm trying to think if this design would benefit from the usage of any sensors and am open to suggestions and ideas!

## Most Difficult Mechanism
For me, I envision that the horizontal travel on a belt would be the most challenging mechanism because it's not intuitive to think of a servo motor creating that kind of motion. However, I realized this motion is somewhat like a pulley motion? So I would try to create that kind of mechanism to achieve this movement. Here is a sketch:

Additionally, I'm struggling to imagine the dimension and form of things. Am I using an actual cup? a flat rendering of the cup? what's the conveyer belt made out of? These are all questions that I hope to pose when we discuss these sketches. 

## Accompanying Audio / Visuals
I believe this machine would benefit a lot from the soundscape of making and drinking coffee. Perhaps over the hour, sounds of conversations and sipping can be playing from a speaker to represent the traditions of social gathering around traditional coffee. And then, at the end, we can hear someone say the Emirati Arabic version of "Thank you, no more coffee," followed by the sound of pouring coffee after the cup travels back to the beginning. 

## Questions and Concerns
* Is this too simple?
* To rephrase an earlier question, what kind of "cup" do I need to have? What is something that can carry a stepper motor while moving?
* Is a servo motor too strong of a motor for gradual horizontal movement? Should I be considering a stepper motor in this case?
* What kind of sensors would this idea benefit from?
