# Paper Scroll Machine

For some reason, ever since the professor posed the concept of a clock tower, the idea of a rolling paper scroll has been on my mind. 

When thinking of machine, I'm think of creating the same kind of impact that a cartoon flipbook, or a surrealist "exquisite corpse" has, this impact of unraveling small parts of something whole.

However, for both a flipbook and exquisite corpse, figuring out a tight folding interaction would be necessary, which makes this task significantly more difficult, I think. So I started thinking of paper rolls. 
The interaction I have in mind is that we, collectively as a class, draw on a complete roll of paper, kind of like the rolls used to print receipts. While drawing, we try to either create a coherent story, or just a consistent drawing where one part bleeds into the other. Then, this machine would unravel sections of the drawing every hour.

I'm not sure if a stepper motor is the right choice in this situation, but I highlighted it in my sketch because it would enable me to create precise motion. Each display or drawing would have the same width as the prior display, and small inconsistencies might lead the machine to be completely offset by the end of the roll. Additionally, this doesn't seem like the kind of machine that would require exceptional speed or force. 

## Questions

* Is this too simple? If so, how can I make it more complex?
*  How would I ensure that the the paper rolls tightly on the other side? Do I create some sort of surrounding container? -- Paper folding and ripping everywhere due to lack of tight rolling is an anticipated issue
*  Stepper Motor or Servo Motor? 
*  How can this be a bit more relevant to the clock theme -- is there a need for interactions beyond hourly interactions?
