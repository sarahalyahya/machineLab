# Prototype
## Idea
For this prototype, I initially wasn't sure how to tackle my idea and how I can reduce it to one prototype-able element. I reached out to the professor and he gave me the suggestion of trying to create a conveyer belt as it was the main mechanism I was thinking of.
So _conveyer belt_ it is! 

## Process
I wanted to stick to cardboard as that was what I got comfortable with the first assignment, and I found it to be a good way to test out things. So I broke down a conveyer belt to simple parts:
+ a rolling belt (I used A4 paper)
+ two rolling cones (I used stacked water bottle caps taped together and stuck bamboo sticks through them, as I couldn't find a toilet paper roll with a good enough size.)
+ side walls

I started putting together the belt, testing different lengths of the a4 paper to achieve minimal points where the roll could get stuck. Overall, it was a clear construction and I managed to achieve what I had in mind for this prototype. 


## Struggles
My main struggle was definitely achieving the motor -- bamboo stick connection. I tried to work around it by using a straw connector and making the bamboo stick thicker using tape, but it still wasn't perfect. This is something that I will definitely get more practice with over time, and trial and error.
